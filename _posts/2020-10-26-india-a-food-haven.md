A friend of mine asked me, what is Indian cuisine like ? And I was not able to put words to my thoughts, as it is difficult to explain Indian cuisine in terms of a few dishes. From west to east, from north to south, India has probably one of the most diverse cuisines in the entire world. Move to any part of India, and you will always find something new to eat. 

That got me thinking about writing this blog post as part of a series. This is my humble effort to be able to showcase some of the dishes that India has to offer. More specifically, I have tried to cook one dish from each state of India. In the coming months, I will try to add to this.

[At the time of writing, I haven't tried my hand at cooking non-vegetarian food. But hey, you never know, in the coming months I might try something.]

So here we go.

<b>Aloo Posto from West Bengal </b>

This is a classical Bengali dish. This preparation relies on the flavours of green chillies and poppy seeds with potatoes.

It consists of misal (a spicy curry usually made from moth beans) and pav (an Indian bread). The dish is then topped with farsan, onion, coriander and lemon.
