6 . Although no complete skeletons have been found, estimates of the dinosaurâ€™s length (based on projections using existing fossils) range from 37 to 40 meters, and it was thought to have weighed 99 to 110 tons. By these measures, it was the largest dinosaur, as well as the largest land animal, ever known.
