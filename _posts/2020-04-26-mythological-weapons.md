Hindu mythology is filled with the use of divine weapons during the wars as well as during individual battles. Here are some of the weapons which find mention in these texts.

<b>Brahmastra</b>

Brahmastra, along with its variants like Brahmashira Astra, is considered to be one of the deadliest weapon. It belongs to Lord Brahma, and can be obtained by a great penance and sacrifice from either Lord Brahma or Lord Shiva. Once used on an individual enemy or an army, it leads to total destruction. It can however be withdrawn after being released. A few warriors possessed the knowledge of Brahmastra through the ages, and there have been instances of it being used. Vishwamitra (when he was still a king) used it on Sage Vasishtha. Vashishtha was able to stop it using the Brahmadanda (the staff of Brahma). In Ramayana, Lord Rama used it to kill Ravana. Ravana's son Meghanad had earlier used it on Hanuman, but he was protected because of a boon given by Lord Brahma. During the Mahabharata, Arjuna and Ashwatthama use it against each other, however they are pursuaded to withdraw it. Arjuna does it, but Ashwatthama doesn't know how to, so it is redirected to the womb of Uttara, Abhimanyu's wife. He died in the womb and is later revived by Lord Krishna.

<b>Narayanastra</b>

It was a weapon of Lord Vishnu. When released, it would bring a shower of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously, destroying everything in its path. The only way to be saved from it is by submitting to it. This happens in Mahabharata, when during the war, Ashwatthama uses the weapon on the Pandava army. Lord Krishna instructs the army to lay down their weapons and bow down. All except Bheem comply, who still shoots arrows at the incomming projectiles. However, he is finally saved by a timely intervention. In the Mahabharata, the knowledge of Narayanastra is with Lord Krishna, Dronacharya, and Ashwatthama. In the Ramayana, Lord Rama and Meghanad know about this weapon. There is also a reference in some texts about the use of this weapon by King Raghu (ancestor of Lord Rama), on Ravana's army. The weapon was supposed to be used in a war only once. If used another time, it could destroy self's army.

<b>Pashupatastra</b>

This was a weapon of Lord Shiva which he gave to Arjuna. Arjuna actually received this weapon twice. The first time when he was instructed to do so by Indra. The second time was during the battle, the day before Arjuna went on to kill Jayadrath. Pashupatastra can be released by mind, eye, words, and by a bow. As explained by Lord Shiva, no one is infallible to this weapon, but it should never be used on a weaker opponent, otherwise it will destroy the entire universe. Arjuna never used this weapon in the war. In some texts, it is also mentioned that Meghanad, son of Ravana in Ramayana, also possessed this weapon.

<b>Teen Baan</b>

Barbarik was the holder of Teen Baan (literally translated to "three arrows"). In some stories, he is given the arrows by Lord Shiva, in some others he is given the arrows by Ashtadeva. As explained by him to Lord Krishna, with the first arrow he can mark all targets he wants to destroy, with the second arrow he can mark all the things he wants to save, and with the third arrow he can either destroy everything which is marked by the first arrow, or not marked by the second arrow. As the popular legend goes, Lord Krishna asked him to target all leaves from a nearby tree. He had silently plucked a leaf and hid it under his foot. When Barbarik shot the first arrow, it marked all the leaves and then hovered over Lord Krishna's feet. Barbarik mentioned that there must be a leaf under Lord Krishna's foot, and he must remove it, or the arrow will pierce his foot and mark the leaf. Lord Krishna realized the true power of this warrior, and knowing it would be difficult to isolate anyone from him, asks for his head. As a favour, Barbarik asks for the power to watch the battle. Krishna takes his head and puts it atop a nearby mountain from where Barbarik saw the entire battle.

<b>Vasavi Shakti</b>

This was a weapon of Indra, a spear which could kill anyone it was targeted at. It was given to Karna by Indra. As the legend goes, Karna was born with kundala and kavach (body armour) which was impenetrable. Indra tricked him into giving it away. Impressed by his generosity though, Indra gave him the Vasavi Shakti, saying it was going to kill anyone Karna threw it at, but it could be used only once, after which it would return to Indra. Karna had reserved it for use on Arjuna, but during the war, Duryodhana pressued him into using the weapon on Ghatotkacha (son of Bheema).

<b>Naagpasha</b>

This is mentioned in the Ramayana. Maghanad uses the weapon on Rama and Lakshman. It is described as a trap made of a million snakes, who entwine the victim and bit and poison. With Rama and Lakshman in danger, Hanuman requested Garuda, king of birds and enemy of serpents, for help. Terrified at Garuda's swoop from the sky, naagpaash loosened its grip, and snakes slither away. Garuda then nurses both to health.

<b>Gandharvastra</b>

This was created by the Gandharva king Chitrasena. The one who invokes this is given superhuman speed, and if used, can create an illusion of a person being at multiple places at the same time. Chitrasena gave it to Arjuna before the battle of Mahabharata, who in turn had imparted it to his son Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu used it while entering the chakravyuha. Before that, it was used by Lord Rama once during the battle. It is said that in a space of 3 hours, Rama destroys a huge portion of Ravana's army, including chariots, elephants, infantry and cavalry.

<b>Anjalikastra</b>

This was a personal weapon of Lord Indra. It would decapitate the person it was used on. According to different sources, there have been two mentions of the use of this weapon. The most famous one is the use by Arjuna to kill Karna. After Karna's chariot is stuck in the ground and he has forgotten the use of Brahmastra (due to a curse by Parashuram), Arjuna is instructed by Lord Krishna to kill Karna, as Karna had also not followed Dharma while killing Abhimanyu. Prior to this, there is a mention of the use of this weapon by Lakshman to kill Meghanad.
