Ilha da Queimada Grande is a small island off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently uninhabited, with the only people having access to the island being the Brazilian Navy and researchers authorized by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment.

Why you may ask ?

It is because the island is the home of (and filled with) the venomous Golden Lancehead Pit Viper.

The island was once connected to the mainland Brazil, but around 11000 years ago sea levels rose to isolate it, causing the snakes to evolve into a unique species. These species, evidently, are not found anywhere else in the world.

By some estimates, there is one snake per square metre of the island, lending the island it's nickname - "Snake Island". The golden lancehead is among the top ten most venomous snakes in the world, and on this island you can find them everywhere, camouflaged on trees, or crawling on the land.

These snakes don't have any prey on ground, which is why they have taken to crawling up on trees and hunting the birds. Although there are 41 recorded species of birds on the island, the golden lancehead preys on only two : the southern house wren, and the Chilean elaenia (a species of flycatcher).

Normally snakes bite their prey and wait, tracking the prey later when the venom has taken its effect. Since tracking birds might be difficult, the golden lancehead has evolved an incredibly potent venom, which kills its prey almost instantly.

There is a lighthouse on the island, and the navy has taken to making routine trips to change the batteries for this. Legend has it that once upon a time there was a lighthouse keeper who lived here with his family. They were wiped out by golden lanceheads crawling into their house through the windows. There is also the case of fishermen dying in a pool of blood after being attacked. These have been unsubstantiated, and there have been no officially recorded deaths from the snake bite.

The anti-venom for these vipers is found at the Butanta Institute in Sao Paulo. The institute has golden lanceheads for milking and research purposes.
